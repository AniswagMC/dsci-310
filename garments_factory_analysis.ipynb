    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "The trillion-dollar garment industry is largely fueled by the production and performance of employees that work in manufacturing companies as a labor-intensive, low-skilled industry (Hamja et al., 2019). As the industry is driven by ever-changing consumer demands and fashion trends, the need for manual processes is inevitable. Through statistical inference, we seek to dig deeper into the relationship between important attributes of the garment manufacturing process and its employees’ productivity in the following question: **What factors affect the productivity of a garment factory?** \n",
    "\n",
    "The studies: “Enhancing Efficiency and Productivity of Garment Industry by Using Different Techniques” (Rajput et al., 2018) and “The Effect of Lean on Occupational Health and Safety and Productivity in the Garment Industry” (Hamja et al., 2019) will be utilized to help frame our exploration into this data set and provide useful context of the garment industry.\n"

    "The data set we will use, called Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees, is sourced from Kaggle.com and outlines following variables that will guide us in answering our question:\n",
    "- `date`: Date in MM-DD-YYYY\n",
    "- `quarter`: A portion of a month, where each month was divided into 4 quarters\n",
    "- `department`: Associated department\n",
    "- `day`: Day of the week\n",
    "- `team`: Associated team number\n",
    "- `targeted_productivity_set`: Daily target productivity set by authority\n",
    "- `smv`: Standard Minute Value; allocated time for a task\n",
    "- `wip`: Work in progress; includes number of unfinished items for products\n",
    "- `over_time`: amount of overtime by each team (minutes)\n",
    "- `Incentive`: amount of financial incentive in BDT (Bangladeshi currency)\n",
    "- `idle_time`: amount of time where production was interrupted\n",
    "- `Idle_men`: number of workers idle due to interrupted production\n",
    "- `no_of_style_changes`: number of style changes\n",
    "- `no_of_workers`: number of workers in given team\n",
    "- `actual_productivity`: actual % of productivity delivered\n",
    "\n",
    "From this list, `date` and `team` were excluded in our analysis as they are identifiers for the observation, hence not the interest for our research question."

    "# Discussion #\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings ##\n",
    "### Model Selection with Forward Selection and LASSO ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables selected from forward selection in our model were: `targeted_productivity`, `smv`, `wip`, `incentive`, `idle_men`, and `no_of_style_change`. The variables selected from LASSO in our model were:  `targeted_productivity`, `smv`, `incentive`, `idle_men`, and `no_of_style_change`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the models produced a fairly poor adjusted $R^2$ values of 0.17 and 0.169 when testing the model with the testing data. Additionally, neither of the selected models were significantly better than the full model according to the corresponding F-tests. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations ###\n",
    "The relatively poor performance of both selected models and the non-significant results from the corresponding F-tests may be due to the assumptions made throughout our analysis. The techniques learned in this class were likely not able to overcome the limitations and assumptions made throughout our analysis. As shown by the various model assumption plots (Figures 5,7,9) throughout the analysis, the assumptions of equal variance and normality were used when analyzing the response variable, as well as both of the models selected via forward selection and LASSO. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of normality was required for the F-tests used near the end of our analysis. With our diagnostic plots shown earlier showing some violation of the assumption, it may impact our results when testing for whether the models we selected were statistically different than the full model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor that may have led to our results being non-significant relative to the full model is the response variable (`actual productivity`) ranges from 0 to 1 while our explanatory variables have much broader ranges. In addition, the variables `wip`, `incentive`, `idle_time`, and `idle_men`, used in our analysis contained a large amount of 0s with a few observed large values leading to abnormal distributions of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues regarding normality and heteroskedasticity in our data and models may have resulted in inaccurate standard errors and thus induced lower precision from coefficient estimates, as well as inaccurate p-values and F-statistics. These limitations may have affected the statistical significance of our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The common variables included from both forward selection and LASSO were `targeted_productivity`, `smv`, `incentive`, `idle_men`, and `no_of_style_change`. The models suggest that the daily set productivity, allocated time for a task, financial incentive, number of idle workers, and number of style changes have the strongest correlation with actual productivity. These findings can drive business decisions of those in management and leadership positions as they could potentially manipulate each variable to drive the highest amount of productivity, and thus, profit. For example, a higher monetary incentive per item will motivate workers to be more efficient, and can have higher payoffs overall, though one should be cautious of unsatisfactory work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study “Enhancing Efficiency and Productivity of Garment Industry by Using Different Techniques” relays methods of increasing productivity by eliminating factors such as idle time, related to the ‘idle_men’ variable in our model. These methods include time study, implementing a visual management system, and standardized work procedures which increased efficiency by 8.07% (Rajput et al., 2018). Focussing on decreasing the number of style changes through process management can also increase productivity where less set-up and transition times between patterns reduce time wasted. “The effect of lean on occupational health and safety and productivity in the garment industry” outlines lean methodology where waste is minimized by reducing variability on all fronts of production (Hamja et al., 2019). While there is evidence of positive effects on productivity by using lean, the literature also points to a potential negative impact on workers’ health– which morally outweighs monetary profit (Hamja et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Questions ###\n",
    "\n",
    "This study prompts further questions about the garment industry. How can we improve these variables to have a more efficient productivity? What is the threshold of which productivity is maximized? What other variables outside of this dataset, particularly involving technological innovation, affect productivity? What is the environmental impact of increasing productivity?"
